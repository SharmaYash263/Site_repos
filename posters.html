                <p class="art-description">
                    “Gorillaz-All Here” was created on July 1, 2024, using a combination of fineliner, gel pens, color pencil, permanent markers, water markers, alcohol markers, and highlighter.
                    This drawing features the popular UK artist Gorillaz, and its quality lies in the exactness of the details compared to the official poster.
                    The combination of multiple materials makes this piece truly one of a kind, showcasing a unique blend of textures and colors that bring the artwork to life.
                    I’m particularly proud of how the different mediums came together to create a cohesive and striking piece that captures the essence of the original poster.
                    This was created on 11x14 Inch Heavyweight Art Paper, as it was optimal for it's size and the thickness/quality of the paper, allowing for further application of mediums.

                    “Black Noir 5/19 Variant” was crafted on June 4, 2024, using a blend of pencil, colored pencils, and permanent markers.
                    This artwork serves as a custom comic cover for Black Noir from The Boys, showcasing a unique variation of the superhero’s suit.
                    The meticulous planning, especially the anatomical precision of Black Noir, posed a significant challenge, yet it was accomplished with exquisite detail over time.
                    The use of shading to depict a vivid, menacing storm in the backdrop, coupled with intricate elements like the barcode and sticker tag, rendering this piece exceptional.
                    This was created on 11x14 Inch Heavyweight Art Paper, as it was optimal for it's size and the thickness/quality of the paper, allowing for further application of mediums.

                    “Master Roshi” was created on August 31, 2023, using a combination of fineliner, gel pens, color pencil, permanent markers, water markers, alcohol markers, and highlighter.
                    This drawing features Master Roshi from Dragon Ball, adorned with graphic tattoos and smoking a cigarette.
                    The heavy styling was referenced from an image online, but the size of the drawing made maintaining consistent lines and marker strokes a crucial element.
                    The neon highlights on the glasses against the contrasting bright red creates a mesmerizing effect under color-changing lights, adding a dynamic and captivating touch to the piece.

                    “Brook One Piece” was created on February 9, 2023, using a combination of fineliner, gel pens, color pencil, permanent markers,
                    water markers, alcohol markers, and highlighter. One of the main reasons this piece stands out to me is because
                    I was able to maintain a professional and consistent level with the mix of materials, successfully executing what I had envisioned. Looking afar, this piece comes together with each individual aspect complimenting eachother.
                    The consistency between the marker strokes in areas such as the hair, to the clothes was done to ensure a highly-rated, quality product.
                    This was created on 11x14 Inch Heavyweight Art Paper, as it was optimal for it's size and the thickness/quality of the paper, allowing for further application of mediums.
                    However, I had cut off 1 inch on each vertical side, leading towards a total size of 11x12 inches.

                    This drawing is a wanted poster of Monkey D. Luffy in his new Gear 5 form, inspired by the wanted posters that appear in the One Piece series.
                    The piece captures the essence of the character and the iconic style of the series’ wanted posters, and I'm beyond satisfied with the quality of this drawing, as it came out perfectly, with precise lines, vibrant colors,

                    "J.Cole" created on August 26, 2020, uses fineliner pen, pencil, and alcohol markers.
                    The poster captures J.Cole’s powerful presence with its bold color contrasts and detailed rendering.
                    The alcohol markers were used to achieve vibrant hues, while the fineliner pen and pencil added intricate details and depth.
                    I am particularly fond of the striking color palette, of shades of grey with a striking red, defining the main features of the poster effectively.
                    Ideally, in future projects I will be able to improve upon my ability to blend various techniques and incorporate various mediums and techniques. This piece is 9x12 inches.

                    “Stellar Creations” was completed on July 9, 2018, using watercolor, acrylic paints,water marker, pencil, Glaze, and fineliner pen.
                    One of the trickiest aspects of this piece was working on poster board rather than traditional watercolor paper,
                    which required careful consideration at each step. The glaze would be used to create a shiny effect, which was only applied to the galaxy area.
                    The astronaut featured is the same character from "Astral Plane" and "Launch Break". I knew when I had created this piece, using the glaze and
                    other listed mediums would go onto create a quality product.

                    Knowing I had to use a single color, I was able to adapt to different shades to create a dynamic, three-dimensional effect.
                    Rather than using color pencil or marker to create these different shades, I chose watercolor to expand my ability.
                    This piece was the first in which I had specifically set out to create for the decoration/poster aesthetic. This was created on A3 paper.
