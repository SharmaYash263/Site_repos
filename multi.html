                    “The Mad Titan’s Triumph” was created on July 31, 2023, and uses a combination of fineliner pen, water marker, and color pencil.
                    This piece was created after the release of Avengers: Endgame. The idea stemmed from imagining a comic-accurate,
                    more vengeful Thanos triumphing over the MCU Avengers. I experimented with mixing colored fineliners and water markers to employ a different shading technique.
                    The result is a detailed background that captures the intensity and drama of the scene, making it worthy of a cover issue.

                    “Flamin Hot” was completed on March 13,2023, employs a mix of fineliner, pencil, and water marker.
                    This piece was a project where I focused on creating a detailed foreground that would blend seamlessly into the background.
                    I aimed for a solid, consistent application using colored pencils, ensuring the deep shades of purple blended with as little white as possible.
                    Additionally, this project provided an opportunity to refine my skills with different sizes of fineliners, enhancing the depth of the image.

                    “Killing Joke” was created on  March 30,2019, and uses a combination of fineliner pen, pencil, and water marker.
                    This piece was inspired by DC’s “The Killing Joke” and helped me practice layering water markers to the best of my abilities.
                    I focused on proportions and aimed to create a stylized yet recognizable villain face. I worked on developing a poster-esque design, identifying areas for improvement along the way.
                    This was before I eventually transitioned to using alcohol markers for more refined results.

                    "Masked Elemental" was created on February 4, 2019, uses a combination of pencil, fineliner pen, and water markers.
                    The creation of this piece demanded precise attention to detail to balance the dynamic elements within the composition and ensure proper proportionality.
                    I focused on creating a dynamic piece with a similar, yet stylized character design, blending it into a poster design. Working on the dragon designs was
                    especially enjoyable, as it allowed me to experiment, and later om became a piece I have dispalyed.

                    I gradually began adding layers of water marker to increase saturation, later mixing to create different shades consistent
                    with the style. To avoid overshading, I only layered in the darkest shadow areas.
                    In other areas, I focused on achieving a consistent quality of application, ensuring there were no visible marker streaks.

                        “Multimedia Pen Sketch" created in 2018, employs a mix of different types of pens, and colored highlighters.
                        In these sketches, I didn’t aim for any specific design.
                        Instead, I treated it as an exercise in spontaneous drawing and developing an adaptive mindset.
                        Once something was drawn in pen or highlighter, there was no erasing.
                        Although combining these mediums might seem limiting, it pushed me to think creatively about different ways to create textures and designs,
                        while also allowing me to use bright colors and quick, flashy designs.

                    practice the fundamental skill of repetition in order to improve my effectiveness over time. Through this process,
                    I’ve become more accurate with using fineliner to create bold outlines and more proficient with color pencils, steadily refining my technique with each iteration.

                        I used this piece to practice combining different markers and highlighters, exploring qualities like saturation, texture, and how these mediums interact.
                        I experimented with layering, such as applying water markers over alcohol markers, which proved valuable in discovering the specific color and texture effects.

                    I focused on creating a background that aligned with the angle at which Gogeta was approaching, ensuring it was packed with details fitting of a devastating battle.
                    Watercolor was used to create a dynamic Ki effect, while sprinkles of white acrylic paint enhanced the energy and intensity of the scene.
                    To prevent the paper from tearing, I opted for color pencil in the background and surrounding details, avoiding excessive moisture.
                    This approach allowed me to maintain the integrity of the paper while achieving a vivid and powerful composition.

                    “Inferno” created in November 13,2017, uses color pencil and fineliner.
                    The vibrant reds, oranges, and yellows of the color pencils bring the flames to life, creating a dynamic and intense atmosphere.
                    The fineliner adds sharp details to the man’s determined expression and the dragon’s fierce form, emphasizing the connection between the two.

                        “Super Sayain Blue Vegito” and "Super Sayain Rose Goku" were completed in January, 2017, and both use color pencil, pencil, and fineliner.
                        This piece marked my first attempt at creating a two-page spread, where I experimented with boldening different lines to create depth.
                        While I identified areas for improvement, particularly in the background, I’m satisfied with certain aspects of the work, such as the character shading.
                        This experience helped me better understand the balance between line work and shading, contributing to my growth as an artist.

                    “Super Sayain 3 Gotenks” was completed on December 21, 2016, employs a combination of color pencil, and pen.
                    I focused on steadying my hand during the inking phase and becoming more comfortable with color pencils.
                    A valuable side benefit of using color pencils in multiple projects is that I'm learning not only their
                    applications but also how they interact with other materials.
                    This practice helped refine my technique and expand my understanding of different artistic mediums interacting with color pencil.

                    "Mecha Frieza" was completed on December 4, 2016, and is a mix of color pencil, and pen.
                    Creating an alien character, even though non-human, often relies on human proportions depending on the
                    style. By using different shades of grey in the tail and mechanical parts, I aimed to replicate a dynamic metallic effect.
                    I focused on blending various colors of colored pencils consistently to achieve this look.

                    “Super Sayain Rose Gogeta” created November 29, 2016, employs a mix of color pencil, and pen.
                    This piece was a redraw where I focused on learning the basics of stylized proportion.
                    At the time, I had just gotten a new set of colored pencils, and creating a listed palette
                    helped me reference the colors while working on the piece.
                    This is one of my earliest sketchbook pieces, initially drawn out of my admiration for Dragon Ball.
