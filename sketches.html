                    “Gorillaz-All Here”was created on July 1, 2024, using a combination of fineliner, gel pens, color pencil, permanent markers, water markers, alcohol markers, and highlighter.
                    I used the grid method to ensure accurate proportions across a large piece of paper, which allowed me to delve deeply into the details.
                    Alcohol markers helped create seamless blends, while multiple layers of permanent markers achieved a rich, deep color without visible strokes.
                    Colored pencils added texture and adjusted the hue of the marker colors.
                    The most challenging part was initially matching the sketch proportions, but with careful planning, the coloring process went smoothly.

                    “Master Roshi” was created on August 31, 2023, using a combination of fineliner, gel pens, color pencil, permanent markers, water markers, alcohol markers, and highlighter.
                    I used the grid method to ensure the image stayed in proper proportions, and the highlighter on the Gucci logo created a glow effect under colored lights.
                    Multiple layers of alcohol and permanent markers ensured a seamless blend of color.
                    Choosing and planning the correct color for the skin proved to be the most difficult process,
                    as using colored pencils would have created a texture not aligned with the poster design.
                    Combining markers and pencils would have resulted in an unwanted texture, so finding the
                    right marker color was crucial to achieving the desired smooth finish.

                    “Brook One Piece” was created on February 9, 2023, using a combination
                    of fineliner, gel pens, color pencil, permanent markers, water markers, alcohol markers, and highlighter.
                    I didn’t use the grid method for this piece to improve my freehand drawing ability. Drawing the even design on the rounded CD proved to be an interesting challenge.
                    The background was created using a different technique with colored pencils, which made it a fun piece to work on.
                    Combining markers and pencils, or different types of markers, would go onto create different textures,
                    so finding the right application of mediums was crucial to finding the desired textures anf effects.

                    “Wanted: Gear 5 Luffy” was created on November 18, 2022, using fineliner and gel pens, color pencil, permanent markers, water markers, and alcohol markers.
                    Physically drawing the name and “WANTED” in the One Piece typography to the smallest detail proved to be a time-consuming task.
                    Each letter required meticulous attention to capture the unique style and intricate design elements of the original typography.
                    This process demanded patience and precision, ensuring that every curve and line was accurately represented. As the inking added depth and definition, while
                    the coloring enhanced the overall visual appeal, the combination of these techniques resulted in a well-deserved sense of accomplishment, making the time and effort invested in the detailed drawing worthwhile.

                <p class="art-description">
                    “Out-N-In MK4 Supra” was created on August 12, 2022 using pencil, fineliner,highlighter, and watercolor paint.
                    Creating this composition was initially inspired by “7-Twelve” and gas station car photoshoots, with a desire to incorporate a lofi aesthetic.
                    Drawing attention to the car in the center, it was crucial to ensure the car resembled an MK4 Supra and to maintain consistent lighting with the piece’s style.
                    Choosing the right colors for the palette was essential to achieving the desired effects.
                    For instance, using darker shades of blue and gray helped create a dark, stormy sky, adding a dramatic and moody atmosphere to the scene.
                    In contrast, bright, warm colors like yellows and oranges were used for the café sign, making it stand out and adding a cozy, inviting feel.
                    The application of watercolor allowed for smooth transitions and blending, enhancing the overall aesthetic and providing a cool, cohesive palette.

                    “The Homelander” was created on July 14, 2022, using my Apple iPad, Apple Pencil, and Autodesk Sketchbook drawing software.
                    In this phase of the drawing, the initial plans for the design and texture, along with inking, had been completed.
                    What’s currently being shown is the planning of the general light shading and how it would be applied to the uniform, leading to different shades being used.
                    This meticulous process highlights one of the reasons I enjoy digital art: it allows me to get heavily involved in the details without having to move my head into the page.
                    Digital tools make it easier to zoom in and out, adjust lighting, and experiment with different shading techniques, enhancing both precision and creativity.

                    “Blooming Season” created on March 18, 2021, is a digital piece created using the Apple iPad, Apple Pencil, and the drawing software “Autodesk Sketchbook".
                    At this point in the drawing process, the conception and inking had been completed. Progress and brainstorming were focused on the colors and general palette that would be used in the piece.
                    Additionally, other effects, such as an afterglow around the shoulders, were being considered to enhance the overall visual impact.
                    This stage involved careful planning to ensure that the chosen colors and effects would complement the composition and create a different piece to what I've done in the past.

                    By this point in the drawing, I had completed the inking process but hadn’t entirely figured out how I would style and color the piece.
                    I decided to create a poster-esque design to further improve my design abilities. For the color palette,
                    I aimed for a striking contrast using only greys and bright red. This choice added a dramatic effect, with the bright red highlighting key elements against the neutral greys.
                    Experimenting with this limited palette allowed me to explore different shading techniques

                    “David in Pop” created on August 7, 2020, employs a mix of acrylics, pencil, and glaze. By the phase shown in the image,
                    I had already completed the planning and composition, including deciding on the bold shades to be used for each head.
                    Creating the David head multiple times, especially with it appearing multiple times in one piece,
                    taught me how to maintain consistency and focus on similarity.
                    This process helped me ensure that each head looked uniform where necessary, while still allowing for individual details to shine through.

                    I initially scribbled down the idea on a sticky note, which later evolved into a more developed piece on sketchbook paper.
                    The larger size allowed me to use fineliner pens in different sizes to create depth, practice achieving a dominant and consistent
                    color with colored pencils, and apply water markers across large sections.
                    This process helped me refine my techniques and bring the concept effectively.

                    I hadn’t decided how I wanted to style the rest of the piece, but I was leaning towards creating an educational visualization.
                    My idea was to provide information on the real-life story of the statue, along with the myth.

                    me to create a depth and richness unique to pencil work.

                <p>"Anatomy Practice" was created on June 12-15, 2017, using color and regular pencil.
                    The focus of these practice sketches was to learn the fundamentals of human anatomy in drawings, with particular attention to the hands, arms, legs, and torso.
                    Building this foundational knowledge will be invaluable for future projects, as it can be continually improved upon.
