                    This drawing features the popular UK artist Gorillaz, and its quality lies in the exactness of the details compared to the official poster.
                    The combination of multiple materials makes this piece truly one of a kind, showcasing a unique blend of textures and colors that bring the artwork to life.
                    I’m particularly proud of how the different mediums came together to create a cohesive and striking piece that captures the essence of the original poster.

                    “Black Noir 5/19 Variant” was crafted on June 4, 2024, using a blend of pencil, colored pencils, and permanent markers.
                    This artwork serves as a custom comic cover for Black Noir from The Boys, showcasing a unique variation of the superhero’s suit.
                    The meticulous planning, especially the anatomical precision of Black Noir, posed a significant challenge, yet it was accomplished with exquisite detail over time.
                    The use of shading to depict a vivid, menacing storm in the backdrop, coupled with intricate elements like the barcode and sticker tag, rendering this piece exceptional.

                    “Master Roshi” was created on August 31, 2023, using a combination of fineliner, gel pens, color pencil, permanent markers, water markers, alcohol markers, and highlighter.
                    This drawing features Master Roshi from Dragon Ball, adorned with graphic tattoos and smoking a cigarette.
                    The heavy styling was referenced from an image online, but the size of the drawing made maintaining consistent lines and marker strokes a crucial element.
                    The neon highlights on the glasses against the contrasting bright red creates a mesmerizing effect under color-changing lights, adding a dynamic and captivating touch to the piece.

                    One of the main reasons this piece stands out to me is because
                    I was able to maintain a professional and consistent level with the mix of materials, successfully executing what I had envisioned. Looking afar, this piece comes together with each individual aspect complimenting eachother.
                    The consistency between the marker strokes in areas such as the hair, to the clothes was done to ensure a highly-rated, quality product.

                    “Neon Skull” was created on October 19, 2018, using a combination of gel pen, fineliner, highlighter, and acrylic paint.
                    The use of highlighter was particularly effective, as it exhibits a slight glow effect under neon or color-changing lights.
                    This piece allowed me to experiment with different materials and techniques, pushing the boundaries of my expression and
                    resulting in a piece that stands out for its bold effect.

                    ensuring that the dynamic energy and intensity of the character were captured effectively.
                    The careful blending of colors highlight the strength and aura of Goku in this form, and was commissioned as a friend's birthday gift.

                    This piece features a textured background with limited color to emphasize the cross-hatched lines.
                    The intricate cross-hatching technique highlights the detailed features and expressions, bringing the subject to life.
                    The blending of cool colors in the background creates a calm and serene environment, enhancing the overall impact of the piece.

                    The swirling patterns and vivid hues evoke a sense of wonder and exploration.
                    I paid close attention to the interplay of cool and warm colors to create the vibrancy of outer space.
