                    “The Homelander” was created on July 14, 2022, using my Apple iPad, Apple Pencil, and Autodesk Sketchbook drawing software.
                    This stylized piece depicts Antony Starr in his role as “The Homelander” from the series The Boys.
                    It was a massive project that required meticulous attention to texture, design, and poster layout.
                    The custom superhero costume draws inspiration from the comic variant of the series.
                    I’m particularly proud of this piece as it exceeded my expectations,
                    especially in the texture of the suit, the detailed line art in the hair, and the nuanced shading around the face and hair.

                    “7-Twelve” was created on May 16, 2022, using my Apple iPad, Apple Pencil,
                    and Autodesk Sketchbook drawing software.
                    In this digital piece, I depicted a dark blue 1991 Acura NSX parked in front of a parody gas station named “7-Twelve”.
                    The inspiration came from social media posts of custom cars at gas stations.
                    This project was a refreshing change of pace for me, as I was able to create something with a definite form,
                    meticulously following the rules of perspective to ensure the building and vehicle looked accurate.

                    This digital piece features a stylized person sitting against an orange background, dressed in pale-colored clothes.
                    The piece was made as an exploration of color and form,
                    emphasizing  and experimenting the contrast between the vibrant background and the subtle tones of the clothing,
